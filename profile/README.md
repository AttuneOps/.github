# Attune Automation for IT Environment Integration Management

Attune is a highly flexible automation and orchestration solution that 
empowers individuals to configure and execute any task, comparable to 
actions performed by skilled System Administrators using terminals. An 
agentless solution that seamlessly connects to devices using existing 
protocols.

Through our innovative approach, individual steps are composed in 
widely-used scripting languages, meticulously orchestrated into automated 
procedures. These procedures can be easily modified and debugged in 
real-time, with comprehensive log capture and knowledge accessibility. 
Attune enables organisations to effortlessly harness the power of 
automation, reducing manual efforts and elevating operational efficiency to 
new heights.

Our software solution 
**[Attune](https://attuneops.io)** 
automates your **IT Environment Integration Management**. We’re building a 
community of sharable automated and orchestrated processes to be used on the 
Attune platform.

System Administrator’s can leverage the publicly available orchestrated 
blueprints to increase their productivity, and accelerate the delivery of 
projects. System Administrator’s can open-source their own and improve existing 
community orchestrated projects.

**The collective power of a community of talented individuals working in concert 
delivers not only more ideas, but quicker development and troubleshooting when 
issues arise.**

## IT Environment Integration Management

IT Environment Integration Management is the discipline whereby all of the 
deploying, scaling, migrating, and managing of infrastructure, systems, and 
processes are streamlined and captured. These processes may include 
implementing, upgrading, scheduling, automating repetitive tasks, backups, 
data restoration, and disaster recovery.

## SysOps and Attune

SysOps is like being a superhero for computers and technology. They make 
sure that all the computer systems and networks in a company work well and 
are safe. They fix any problems that come up, and make sure that everything 
is running smoothly. They also help with making new computer programs and 
updates to make sure that the technology is always improving. Think of them 
as the ones who keep the technology in a company healthy and running like a 
well-oiled machine.

SysOps have to do a lot of boring and repetitive tasks on their computer 
systems and networks, and it consumes a lot of their time. This means they 
can't do other important things and might not finish their work on time. But, 
there's a special SysOps helper called Attune that can perform those 
repetitive tasks automatically. It makes everything go faster and helps 
SysOps be more efficient.
